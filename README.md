# Pepper's Expense Tracker
An Intranet Site for Peppers Restaurant. This allows the firm to enter and track their budget spending each month. Each restaurant location's manager owns an account that tracks the spending of the location they're managing.

# Beware
I am running this web application on a local network because I cannot mantain the monthly cost of keeping the servers running. Although I have an RDS running that keeps
the database running nation-wide. Therefore, I am willing to share the environment variables for both backend and frontend if you ask for it. Contact me at 
[**angeloangel1989@outlook.com**](**angeloangel1989@outlook.com**) for more information.

# Requirements to Run the Application
Must have the following installed in your local machine:
- VSCode
- MySQL Community Edition
- NodeJS
- GitHub

# Installing dependencies
I have scripts that allow you to install dependencies. Just ensure that you're always running these scripts in the root folder of this repository
```javascript
"npm run backend-install" // Installs backend folder dependencies 
"npm run frontend-install" // Installs frontend folder dependencies 
```

# Running both Frontend and Backend in Development Mode
I also have scripts that allow you to run either backend or frontend from the root folder of this repository. Just ensure you're running them on two separate terminals. You can add
another terminal in VSCode just by pressing **CTRL** and **`** together.
```javascript
"npm run backend" //  Runs backend server
"npm run frontend-dev" // Runs client server
```
